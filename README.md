## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David, and I'm a computer scientist interested in all thing Python & Data Science!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on OpenCore Beta Testing team, supporting the development of open science learning modules in collaboration with Columbia University and Nasa.

âš¡ I recently collaborated in a Jupyter Notebook project that explores the shift in music popularity and genres in the USA during election years, analyzing Spotify data from 2016 to 2023. Check it out [here](https://github.com/DavidFonsecaG/Open-Science-101/tree/main/Group-Projects/Music%20Trends%20During%20Election%20Cycles%20-%20Spotify)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning.
