## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, and I'm a software developer interested in all things Python, Data Science & Full Stack Development!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on OpenCore Beta Testing team, supporting the development of open science learning modules in collaboration with Columbia University and Nasa.

âš¡ I recently collaborated on a Jupyter Notebook project analyzing wildfire burned areas using AVIRIS hyperspectral data and VIIRS thermal hotspots. Check it out [here](https://github.com/DavidFonsecaG/palisades-fire-mapping-aviris-viirs/blob/main/notebooks/mapping_wildfires.ipynb).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning.
